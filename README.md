YTTS is an exploration of enabling semantic search capabilities on a YouTube channel. The idea was initially sparked by Mr. Carlson Lab, whose videos are a deep-dive into antique electronics repair. His videos are information-dense and I would often find myself wishing I could remember some clever method or technqiue for circuit debugging, noise reduction, or performance testing. The ability to semantically search his content for various topcis seemed like exactly the thing.
